# Learning-to-code
This should be fun... Basically just a checklist and copy+paste for milestones/projects

So what this is for is basically going to be like a diary for my learning to code.
I have no clue whether I will even update this and stuff but hopefully I will! Pretty much going to try and progress to as complex as possible.

The websites I am using to learn to code at the moment are SoloLearn and CodeAcademy

Currently okay at:
  Basic Python
  Visual Basic

Working on:
  C# @SoloLearn
  Complex Python @CodeAcademy
